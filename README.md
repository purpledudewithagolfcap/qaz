# Real-time ray-traced audio enhancer (reverb system for short)
Yeah honest to god i'll never do this shit again. 
  I've spent way too much time on this but here are some features this has.
  
1: Late reflection and early reflection.

2: An overly complex reflection system

3: absorption simulation

4: Uses Ray-tracing (not like the rtx one) to determine the reverberation

5: adjustable sample size (5 is recommended)

6: Applies to most if not every sound possible in the Workspace

7: Takes into consideration the room's size and such

8: Each material has its value like Density and Absorption

9: Adjustable distance reach

10: Takes into consideration the distance between rays and the impact point

11: A shit ton of other features I can't name right now but they do exist if your thinking of them
